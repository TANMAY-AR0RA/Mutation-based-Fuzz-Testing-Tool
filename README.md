# Mutation-based-Fuzz-Testing

Designed a C program to implement this mutation based fuzzing test on the given jpeg file (cross.jpg) using mutation technique discussed below. Our primary task was to detect the bugs/crashes in the image conversion program given to us: "jpeg2bmp", by generating the mutated versions of input jpeg files and one by one checking for each of the 10 bugs during this conversion.
